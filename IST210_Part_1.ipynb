    "### Idea 1\n",
    "\n",
    "a. i. The idea is a repository for vehicles, associated gas efficiency, and to see if there are relationships between those two factors and the amount of miles driven on average.\n",
    "---\n",
    "a. ii. This idea has more than likely been done before but we believe it will be a good learning experience from a database/SQL type approach. \n",
    "---\n",
    "a. iii. This could be loosely based on already existing products like GasBuddy but it is a new idea to our group.\n",
    "---\n",
    "a. iv. A typical interaction would be using this data with local government/other interested parties to see how gas prices affect total distance traveled in vehicles with that data being able to be analyzed, applied, and projected to yearly gas price trends.\n",
    "---\n",
    "   1. Gas prices at various local gas stations.\n",
    "   2. Which gas stations were used to refill which vehicle.\n",
    "   3. Vehicle and general gas efficiency of the vehicle.\n",
    "   4. Vehicle and vehicle owner.\n",
    "   5. Vehicle and amount of distance traveled per week.\n",
    "---\n",
    "b. i. The \"end-user\" data for this idea is idea 5.\n",
    "---\n",
    "b. ii. Attributes would include owner names, vehicle make/model, type of gas used to refill vehicles at gas stations, distanced traveled in highway/urbran settings, and an attribute that designates if a car is eco-friendly or not.\n",
    "---\n",
    "c. We do not have any relevent images to add for this idea.\n",
    "---\n",
    "d. The goal of this idea is to see if there is a relationship or an influence between the price of gas and the amount of distance driven. This would be useful data not only for the sake of having data but also to see if the implementation of \"eco-friendly\" cars could influence behaviors.\n",

    "### Idea 2\n",
    "\n",
    "a. i. The main idea in this instance is to create a collection of data that can be used to track meat prices, consumption of meat, and where certain types are sold more than others.\n",
    "---\n",
    "a. ii. From what I know, this collection of data does not exist and could be beneficial to grocers, butchers, and markets nationally.\n",
    "---\n",
    "a. iii.  I imagine some companies already have explored this idea before, but i would consider this an original idea.\n",
    "---\n",
    "a. iv. A typical day in this business would include communicating with multiple meat vendors, helping them find the best prices for meat products.\n",
    "---\n",
    "   1. Type of meat, location, price.\n",
    "   2. Shipping cost to location.\n",
    "   3. Location of suppliers and type of meat supplied.\n",
    "   4. Previous consumer ratings of vendor and amount of sales.\n",
    "   5. Type of meat and average distance traveled to location.\n",
    "---\n",
    "b. i. An \"end-user\" application of this data would be an interface where the consumer could track where the meats been, the shipping prices, and view final prices based on location.\n",
    "---\n",
    "b. ii. Attributes would include shop names, shop locations, shipping companies, meat types, vendor names (farms), and transport type.\n",
    "---\n",
    "c. We do not have any relevent images to add for this idea.\n",
    "---\n",

    "a. i. This idea is to see the relationships at restaurants, such as items that customers frequently order, inventory/pricing.\n",

    "a. ii. This idea is unique because we are analyzing unique relationships at restaurants.\n",
